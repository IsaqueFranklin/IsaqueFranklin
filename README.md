Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught web and mobile developer and I focus on the creation of dynamic websites and apps using a stack of React, React Native, Node and the great Firebase.
I also am interested in python that was actually the first programming language I learned in my life back when I was 13. I'm coding blockchain projects sometimes and I'll probably learn Django and Flask in the near future.

If you liked my repos take a look at my blog profile on the blog platform that I've coded: [Isaque Franklin](http://www.blogme.com.br/usuario/perfil/isaquefranklin)
